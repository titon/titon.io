# Reserved Classes #

We try to avoid declaring global class names, but usually it can't be helped.
Just be weary of the following classes while building an application.

The following classes are reserved by Toolkit:

* All the classes within `base.scss`, `responsive.scss`, and `typography.scss`
* Shape classes: `.round`, `.pill`, `.oval`, `.skew`, `.skew-reverse`
* Size classes: `.small`, `.large`
* Animation classes: `.from-above`, `.from-below`, `.slide`, `.slide-up`, `.slide-in-top`,
    `.slide-in-bottom`, `.slide-in-left`, `.slide-in-right`, `.flip-rotate`,
    `.fade`, `.sticky`, `.push`, `.push-reveal`, `.push-down`, `.reverse-push`,
    `.reveal`, `.squish`, `.on-top`, and many more
* Positional classes: `.top-left`, `.top-center`, `.top-right`, `.center-left`, `.center-right`,
    `.bottom-left`, `.bottom-center`, `.bottom-right`
* State classes: `.is-*`, `.has-*`, `.no-*`, and many more
* Grid and flex components: `.col`, `.end`, `.region`, `.block`

Some classes make use of [Sass variables](../sass/variables.md) for altering their names.
This was implemented to avoid collisions of common class names and integration with legacy applications.

## Namespacing Classes ##

Toolkit supports the prefixing of *ALL* plugins [with CSS namespacing](../namespace.md).
