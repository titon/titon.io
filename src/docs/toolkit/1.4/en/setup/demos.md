# Interactive Demos #

A powerful interactive demo is available within the Toolkit repository. This demo provides an interface
for testing each component individually through an extensible filter system.
Each filter represents a configurable option or feature within a JavaScript component.

Demo testing requires a running PHP web server, as the functionality is easily built and maintained with PHP.
Pre-built PHP environments are available depending on your OS &mdash; simply follow their installation.

Windows
* [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
* [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

Mac
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) + [PHP](https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php) (suggested)
* [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html)

Once a PHP web server is running, and the Toolkit repository is located within the web root,
simply traverse into the `demo` folder located in the repository.
