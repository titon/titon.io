# Code #

Styles for code related HTML tags.

## Usage ##

The code component is extremely lightweight and simple, as all it does is style native code related HTML tags. Font, padding, and display are modified for `pre`, `code`, `kbd`, and `var` tags.

### Scrollable Blocks ###

Apply the `.is-scrollable` class to a `pre` block to overflow its content.

```html
<pre class="is-scrollable"><code>
    ...
</code></pre>
```
